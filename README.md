Ready ? 
Let's go ðŸ”­  

12 years ago, I created my own delivery compagny. Everything was fine, but as long as the years passed, I felt something was wrong.
That's it! I was not in my place. I mean, that was not THE JOB I dreamed of.
And then... I heard about Web development. At this moment I knew what I had to do.

So ... In April 2022, I started to learn JavaScript in a Bootcamp. Something was growing in my mind ðŸŒ±. I want to become a web developer !
During 3 months, I tryed hard to learn JavaScript, React and React Native. And it worked. But from now, nothing is done yet. I have to improve my way to code every day, every hours, every minuts. 

That's why I'm here. I'm here to add as much as possible project so I can reach my goal. 
For now, I'm currently working on my portfolio
